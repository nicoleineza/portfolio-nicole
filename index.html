    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Nicole Ineza, a Kotlin Android developer and Management Information Systems graduate from Ashesi University. I build offline-first, responsive mobile apps for real-world sectors like e-commerce, agriculture, and finance. With both technical and business insight, I turn class projects into funded ventures—like Iteme Shop, our Mastercard Foundation-backed campus e-commerce platform.

        What began as a course assignment—<em>Campus Market App</em>—grew into <strong>Iteme Shop</strong>, a Kotlin-based Android e-commerce platform tailored for Ashesi students. After successful deployment and user testing, we evolved the project into a startup and secured <strong>Mastercard Foundation funding</strong> in 2025.
